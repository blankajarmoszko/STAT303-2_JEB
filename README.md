# STAT303-2_JEB
Final project directory for STAT 303-2.
Current plan of action:
-group the data set by country (not enough years in dataset for prediction) and get mean of each value 
-remove all the missing values - for now
-select a subset of variables using correlation (pairplot and numerical table), then check vif 
-narrow down the subset using variable selection code
-make a model with the final subset

QUESTIONS to ask:
-is grouping data by country ok?
-remove missing values or impute?
-how to check the correctness/goodness of the model?
-should we take it further and find more data?
